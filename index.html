	<p id="margright">Canada is a country, consisting of <strong>ten provinces</strong> and <strong>three territories</strong>, in the northern part of the continent of North America. It extends from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres, making it the world's<strong> second-largest country</strong> by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's common border with the United States forms the world's <strong>longest land border</strong>. Canada is sparsely populated overall, the majority of its land territory being forest and tundra as well as the mountain range of the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the population live near the southern border where Canada's climate is at it's warmest.</p>

  <h3>What does "Canada" mean and where did it come from?</h3>
  	<p>The name <em>Canada</em> comes from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word "<em>kanata</em>, meaning village, land, settlement, or town. In the 17th and 18th centuries, "<em>Canada</em>" referred to the part of New France that lay along the St. Lawrence River. In 1791, the area became two British colonies named Upper Canada and Lower Canada. In 1867 upon Confederation, <em>Canada</em> was named as the legal name for the new independent country.</p>
